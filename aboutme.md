My name is Xingyu Wang, but I usually go by **Tom**. Makes life easier for everyone.

I am an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia, studying Computer Engineering. Expecting to graduate in Aug 2026.

I am passionate about computer architecture, digital design, and embedded systems. These are the areas I am currently focusing on at school. 

Right now, I am doing research on **page miss prefetching** under the supervision of [Shaurya Patel](https://shauryapatel1995.github.io/) and [Prof. Alexandra Fedorova](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~sasha/) in the [UBC Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/)
