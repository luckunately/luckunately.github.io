I was actually in [integrated engineering (IGEN)](https://www.igen.ubc.ca/) for a year before I transferred to [computer engineering (CPEN)](https://engineering.ubc.ca/programs/undergraduate/computer-engineering). 

UBC Engineering is quite different from other universities. We have a common first year, where all engineering students take the same courses and apply for disciplines at the end of the first year. I started as a freshman, with no prior experience in coding, and then I met this horrible course [APSC 160](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/browse-courses/course/COURSE_DEFINITION-3-973_20240901). This course gave me a nightmare, so I was like, "I gotta choose a discipline with no coding!!!!!!!!" That's why I chose integrated engineering as my first choice. CPEN is not even selected. (LMFAO)

Second year IGEN is chill. Because I took MATH 253 in summer, I got a chance to pick an elective in T1 of second year. (BTW, [Prof. Colin Macdonald](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cbm/) is GOAT) After some struggles, I was persuaded by my friend [Jason](https://github.com/Tassadaar): "Nowadays, you can't avoid coding. You gotta learn it." So I decided to be brave and have a taste of [CPEN 223](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/browse-courses/course/COURSE_DEFINITION-3-5502_20240901), which is taught by [Prof. Farshid Agharebparast](https://ece.ubc.ca/farshid-agharebparast/) (Another GOAT). I was like "Hmmm, coding is actually interesting. I can do some cool stuff with it." 

The course that motivated me to make the decision is [CPEN 312](https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-312/), which is part of STT in second year IGEN. It is the first time I learned about **digital circuits** and how compuers work at the lowest level. I was fascinated by the course content and the labs. I was like "I want to learn more about this stuff." So I transferred to computer engineering. (If anyone has time, they should check out the first class of CPEN 312, where [Prof. Jesús Calviño-Fraga](https://ece.ubc.ca/jesus-calvino-fraga/) mocks people from IGEN. It's hilarious. A tradition of CPEN 312 every year. LOL)

So yes, that's how I ended up in computer engineering.
